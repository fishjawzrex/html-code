    <p>The science of Martial Arts called the Individual School of Two Swords is
      something that I have spent many years refining. Now, wishing to reveal it in a book
      for the first time, I have ascended Mount Iwato in Higo province of Kyushu. Bowing to
      Heaven, paying respect to Kannon, I face the Buddha. I am Shinmen Musashi no Kami,
      Fujiwara no Genshin, a warrior born in the province of Harima, now sixty years old.</p>
    <p>I have set my mind on the science of martial arts since my youth long ago. I was thirteen
      years old when I had my first duel. On that occasion I won over my opponent, a martial artist
      named Arima Kihei of the New School of Accuracy. At sixteen years of age I beat a powerful martial artist
      called Akiyama of Tajima province. When I was twenty one, I went to the capital city and met martial artists from
      all over the country. Although I engaged in numerous duels, never did I fail to attain victory.</p>
